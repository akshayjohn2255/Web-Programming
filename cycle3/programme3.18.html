<h1>Mother Nature</h1>
<p>Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals</p>
<p>in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord</p>
<p>such as the weather and geology of the Earth</p>
